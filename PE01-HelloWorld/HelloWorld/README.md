# HelloWorld - React Native App

This is a basic React Native app called **HelloWorld** that simply shows my personal info—my name, degree, and school. I built it following a few specific rules: it had to have a yellow background and only use five React Native components in total — **1 View, 3 Text components, and a StyleSheet**.

## Input

Everything is hardcoded into the app — my name (**Rajdeep Singh Golan**), my degree (**MSCS**), and my school (**STC**), just like the prompt required.

## Process

I used **React Native** to build this. The structure is super simple:
- One `View` acts as the main container.
- Three `Text` components display the name, degree, and school.
- A `StyleSheet` handles all the styling — like setting the yellow background and centering everything on the screen.

## Output

When you run the app, it shows a clean mobile screen with a **yellow background**, and my info is displayed at the **center** in **three separate lines**.
